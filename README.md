#NYC Public School Rating and Student Performance

We wanted to check if there was a relationship between New York City Public High School rating, given by the Department of Education and the school's student attendance and SAT score performance. All our data came from the New York City Open Data source.

[SAT Scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4), 

#Problems with the datas
We noticed that our files had multiple erroneous data, either missing information or input was incorrect. We had to standardized everything.
*Chad, input all the hard work you did here*
After cleaning and aggregating all data into one mega list (mega_data), we started to seed and graph.

#What did the Data say:
We noticed that there is indeed a relationship between a school's official rating and it's student performance.
School that were rated 4 or higher (out of 5) had a lower absent to present ratio as well as scoring higher on the SAT. School with rating of 2 and 3 were similar and more clustered together to the mid-range SAT scores while also having a higher absent to present ratio compared to 4 and 5. Ratings of 0 and 1 had by far the highest absent to present ratio while also having low to mid range SAT scores.

#Result
Our data shows that there is a positive correlation between a school's official rating from the Department of Education and how well the students of said school performs.

#Future Work
We were only able to get information for one year of school, school year 2012-2013. We requested a freedom of information from NYC DOE and if that goes through we will have more data to work with. Then we can compare a school's change in rating over the course of several years and student performance for better validation of our results.
